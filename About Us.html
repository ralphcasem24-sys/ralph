    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Our story began with a child walking through the streets, selling <strong>lumpia</strong> and <strong>turon</strong> with a smile and a dream. At just seven years old, I learned that every roll we sold carried not only flavor but also the effort, love, and hope of our family.</p>

    <p>As I grew older and school became my focus, I could no longer help with selling — but I stayed close to what mattered most. I helped prepare the wrappers, cooked the fillings, and learned the value of patience and care in every step.</p>

    <p>Today, that same love and dedication live on in everything we make. Each product is a reflection of our story — a story of family, perseverance, and the joy of sharing simple food that brings people together.</p>
